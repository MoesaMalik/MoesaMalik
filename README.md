# Moesa Malik

I am a fourth-year Software Engineering student at Carleton University focusing on the intersection of system reliability and quantitative risk. Following R&D internships at Nokia centered on infrastructure stability, I am currently developing a computer vision application for real-time monitoring while specializing in Python. My approach is defined by an interest in market metrics and pattern recognition, transitioning toward the study of robust systems that remain functional under extreme volatility.
